# kmp-pattern-searching
This repository contains source code for Knuth Morris Patterson Pattern Searching algorithm implemented in java. 
It returns the index where a pattern is found and returns -1 if the pattern does not exist in provided text. 
This algorithm uses a temporary array to skip extra steps to optimize pattern searching and
reduces the time complexity to O(m+n) where m is the length of text supplied and n is the length of pattern to be searched.
